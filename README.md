# Machine-Learning-Projects

These projects are created by taking help from various online sources and tutorials and in addition to that, 
added with various links and explanations to brighten up the days and nights of the new and upcoming data scientists and
machine learning enthusiasts like me!

Data files have been atttached wherever needed and the python jupyter notebooks have been clearly explained at each step.
You can expect lots and lots of improvements and changes in the notebooks, with increase in my knowledge base of Data Science 
and Machine Learning and tons of more projects.
